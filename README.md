# autoreconParser
Parses various scan outputs into JSON, and best used with [AutoRecon](https://github.com/Tib3rius/AutoRecon) or a matching file hierarchy.

## Usage
```
autoreconParser.py [path-to-autorecon-output]
- run from the top-most directory above the individual IP output folders, ex. autoreconParser.py /path/to/autoreconoutputs/
```

## Note *most* of the outputs are supported, there are still a few in progress
## Supported Scanner Outputs (plaintext and named as generated by AutoRecon)
- gobuster
- nbtscan
- nikto
- nmap (simple port/protocol/service/state/reason output, no pipe-leading service scanners)
- onesixtyone
- oscanner (Oracle Scanner)
- _patterns.txt (generated by AutoRecon, hits some highlights in the scans)
- robots.txt (as collected from a webserver)
- smbclient
- smbmap (list and share output)
- smtp-user-enum
- snmpwalk
- whatweb

## Not Yet Supported (but coming soon)
- enum4linux
- nmap script outputs
- showmount
- sslscan
- svwar

### Requirements
- [AutoRecon](https://github.com/Tib3rius/AutoRecon) by [Tib3rius](https://github.com/Tib3rius/)
  - The version tested with this project is backed up as AutoRecon-master-20191110.zip in this repo, nothing in that project was altered for this one.
- OR
- Plaintext output from your preferred scanner, following the folder hierarchy IPADDRESS/scans/YOURSCAN.txt
	- this was built with AutoRecon in mind, so you may have to make your own alterations

### To Do
- add the rest of the parsers
- get MAC addresses from Nmap scans (oops!)
- clean up the excessive try/except statements
	- grab errors and write them somewhere for additional processing
- make alternate version for reading all logs in a directory, NOT locked into the ip/scans/* format
- add Splunk dashboards, saved searches, macros, queries, reports, etc
	- setup instructions for Splunk content
